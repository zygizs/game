### **My first real C++ project.**

_Course work for objective programming subject, made to meet certain requirements._

**Personal goals for the project:**

- Menu **+**

- Game over **+** 

- Original sprites **+**

- Game modes **+**

- High score system **+**

- OSD for current game mode and current high score **+**

_"+" is completed, " - " is not._

**Personal thoughts on the project:**
The project could be improved upon, but because it was made to meet certain requirements it would rather be rebuilt from the ground up. Time to move on to bigger projects.
